Can R2 be greater than 1?
- The value greater than 1 can be calculated if the equation of R2 for linear model is applied to non-linear model. The result is thus non-sense. See the thread [Can R2
be greater than 1?](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/334004/can-r2-be-greater-than-1).
- R2 reflects the portion of the variation of Y explained by X via the model. See [Avoid R-squared to judge regression model performance](https://towardsdatascience.com/avoid-r-squared-to-judge-regression-model-performance-5c2bc53c8e2e)
